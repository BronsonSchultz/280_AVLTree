# 280_AVLTree
A full implementation and regression testing of an AVL Tree data structure in Java

This data structure relies on some defined exceptions found in the lib package
Anything found within the lib280 package outside of AVLNode and AVLTree was not written by me.

to run this program on the unix command line you either need the Java JDK to compile the classes and run the generated class files
or you can run the included class files with just the java JRE

If your working directory contains the .java files
