# 280_AVLTree
A full implementation and regression testing of an AVL Tree data structure in Java

This data structure relies on some defined exceptions found in the lib package
Anything found within the lib280 package outside of AVLNode and AVLTree was not written by me.


Assuming your working directory is 280_AVLTree, to run this program on the unix command line, I have included a `.jar` file to make it easier, run:

```
java -jar out/artifacts/lib280_asn4_jar/lib280-asn4.jar
```
this will compile all needed class and run the regression test of the tree.
